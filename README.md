# Drieze's Zip App

My own simple zip application...
I made this application because I needed to zip all folders in a specific directory.
Instead of looking for existing software I just made it myself.

## Features

Almost none! :-)

- Basic compression from System.IO.Compression
- Copy/paste path in textbox
- Choose if you want an existing zip-file to be deleted or not, or just warn you with a simple messagebox
- Progressbar
- Log

## Todo's
- Instead of a warning messagebox show the oppurtunity to cancel the progress.
- Expand with more functions when I need new zip-functions for an other project.
